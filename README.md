# bomberman_rl - solutions by M.R. and R.S.
Setup for a project/competition amongst students to train a winning Reinforcement Learning agent for the classic game Bomberman.

We want to submit our trained agent that can be found under bla_agent to the competition. This agent does not require additional packages and does not use artificial neural networks.

We also added two other agents to our solution (dqn_agent and dqn_simple_agent). They rely on the pytorch package and use artificial neural networks. Running these agents requires ANN.py (containing some self written methods for setting up the neural networks) to be in the working directory. As we are not happy with the performance of these agents (see project report) we do not want them to compete in the tournament.
